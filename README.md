# AppUtility
AppUtility is a library which contains small code snippets that we need in almost every project like converting color hex to rgb, checking internet connectivity, etc.

# Installation
Just drag the folder "AppUtility" with the source files into your project.

# Usage
```Swift
//Using direct RGB value no need to divide every time with 255.0
UIColor.init(redValue: 199, greenValue: 165, blueValue: 247)

//Getting color with hex value
UIColor.init(hex: 0xffffff)

//Display alert view
AUAlertMessage().showAlertView("Title", message: "Message", cancelButtonTitle: "Cancel")
```

# Contribution
Feel free to add code which you think is necessary in almost every project.
